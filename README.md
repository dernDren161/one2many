**one2many** is a web application that lets users store/list in all their important digital data under one directory and have easy access to it.

### How it works?
Using **one2many** is pretty simple.
* Users go into the portal and simply add in their details such as: their *username*/*login id* or important *password* information.
* They can edit,update or delete the information anytime.
* While adding their personalized information, they put in their digital **Signature** in a textual form, just to assure the authenticity of the information added. 

## Run it on your local machine

* Used Ruby version:  `ruby 2.5.1p57`

* Database creation: The application uses `MYSQL` for database storage and management.

* Database initialization: Credentials for database access: 
                          - `username`: **one2many**
                          - `password`: **may2one**

* Run: `bundle install` before running it on `localhost:3000`
